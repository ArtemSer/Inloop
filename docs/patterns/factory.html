						<b>Factory</b> is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a
						superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
					</p>
					<p class="center">

							Problem
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>
						Imagine that you’re creating a logistics management application. The first version of your app can only
						handle transportation by trucks, so the bulk of your code lives inside the <code>Truck</code> class.
					</p>
					<p class="center">
						<img class="mh-4" src="./assets/factory/Logistic_App.png" alt="">
					</p>
					<p>
						Great news, right? But how about the code? At present, most of your code is coupled to the
						<code>Truck</code> class. Adding <code>Ships</code> into the app would require making changes to the entire
						codebase. Moreover, if later you decide to add another type of transportation to the app, you will probably
						need to make all of these changes again.
					</p>
					<p>
						As a result, you will end up with pretty nasty code, riddled with conditionals that switch the app’s
						behavior depending on the class of transportation objects.
					</p>
					<div class="title">
						<div class="title_inner">
							<span class="ion ion-checkmark-circled"></span>
							Solution
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>
						The Factory Method pattern suggests that you replace direct object construction calls (using the
						<code>new</code> operator) with calls to a special <em>factory</em> method. Don’t worry: the objects are
						still created via the <code>new</code> operator, but it’s being called from within the factory method.
						Objects returned by a factory method are often referred to as “products.”
					</p>
					<p class="center">
						<img class="mh-5" src="./assets/factory/Solution.png" alt="">
					</p>
					<p>
						At first glance, this change may look pointless: we just moved the constructor call from one part of the
						program to another. However, consider this: now you can override the factory method in a subclass and change
						the class of products being created by the method.
					</p>
					<p>
						There’s a slight limitation though: subclasses may return different types of products only if these
						products have a common base class or interface. Also, the factory method in the base class should have its
						return type declared as this interface.
					</p>
					<p class="center">
						<img class="mh-5" src="./assets/factory/Solution_Details.png" alt="">
					</p>
					<p>
						For example, both <code>Truck</code> and <code>Ship</code> classes should implement the
						<code>Transport</code> interface, which declares a method called <code>deliver</code>. Each class implements
						this method differently: trucks deliver cargo by land, ships deliver cargo by sea. The factory method in the
						<code>RoadLogistics</code> class returns truck objects, whereas the factory method in the
						<code>SeaLogistics</code> class returns ships.

						You plan to visit Rome for a few days and visit all of its main sights and attractions. But once there, you
						could waste a lot of time walking in circles, unable to find even the Colosseum.
					</p>
					<p>
						On the other hand, you could buy a virtual guide app for your smartphone and use it for navigation. It’s
						smart and inexpensive, and you could be staying at some interesting places for as long as you want.
					</p>
					<p>
						A third alternative is that you could spend some of the trip’s budget and hire a local guide who knows the
						city like the back of his hand. The guide would be able to tailor the tour to your likings, show you every
						attraction and tell a lot of exciting stories. That’ll be even more fun; but, alas, more expensive, too.
					</p>
					<p>
						All of these options—the random directions born in your head, the smartphone navigator or the human
						guide—act as iterators over the vast collection of sights and attractions located in Rome.

							Structure
						</div>
					</div>
					<p class="center">

					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							The <b>Iterator</b> interface declares the operations required for traversing a collection: fetching the next
							element, retrieving the current position, restarting iteration, etc.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Concrete Iterators</b> implement specific algorithms for traversing a collection. The iterator object should
							track the traversal progress on its own. This allows several iterators to traverse the same collection
							independently of each other.
						</li>
						<li>
							The <b>Collection</b> interface declares one or multiple methods for getting iterators compatible with the
							collection. Note that the return type of the methods must be declared as the iterator interface so that
							the concrete collections can return various kinds of iterators.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Concrete Collections</b> return new instances of a particular concrete iterator class each time the client
							requests one. You might be wondering, where’s the rest of the collection’s code? Don’t worry, it should be
							in the same class. It’s just that these details aren’t crucial to the actual pattern, so we’re omitting
							them.
						</li>
						<li>
							The <b>Client</b> works with both collections and iterators via their interfaces. This way the client isn’t
							coupled to concrete classes, allowing you to use various collections and iterators with the same client
							code.
							<br><br>
							Typically, clients don’t create iterators on their own, but instead get them from collections. Yet, in
							certain cases, the client can create one directly; for example, when the client defines its own special
							iterator.
						</li>
					</ol>
					<div class="title">
						<div class="title_inner">
							<span class="ion ion-android-bulb"></span>
							Applicability
						</div>
					</div>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Use the Iterator pattern when your collection has a complex data structure under the hood, but you want to
							hide its complexity from clients (either for convenience or security reasons).
						</li>
						<li>
							The iterator encapsulates the details of working with a complex data structure, providing the client with
							several simple methods of accessing the collection elements. While this approach is very convenient for
							the client, it also protects the collection from careless or malicious actions which the client would be
							able to perform if working with the collection directly.
						</li>
						<li>
							Use the pattern to reduce duplication of the traversal code across your app.
						</li>
						<li>
							The code of non-trivial iteration algorithms tends to be very bulky. When placed within the business logic
							of an app, it may blur the responsibility of the original code and make it less maintainable. Moving the
							traversal code to designated iterators can help you make the code of the application more lean and clean.
						</li>
						<li>
							Use the Iterator when you want your code to be able to traverse different data structures or when types of
							these structures are unknown beforehand.
						</li>
						<li>
							The pattern provides a couple of generic interfaces for both collections and iterators. Given that your
							code now uses these interfaces, it’ll still work if you pass it various kinds of collections and iterators
							that implement these interfaces.
						</li>
					</ol>
